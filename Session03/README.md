# Session 03 - 08/29/17


## Intro and Recap
* Miscellaneous reminders:
    * Still some new faces today. Probably last day that we'll have new people. I think you guys have filled up my class.
    * Remember that lecture slides, notes, and reading will be on [github](https://github.com/ivaylopg/Tech421Tech3706)
    * First session of each week will usually be talking/discussion, second sessions will be more technical.
* Topic Recap
    * We want to come up with a working definition of AR/VR
        * _Inducing targeted behavior in an organism by using artificial sensory stimulation, while the organism has little or no awareness of the interference._ - LaValle
        * Immanuel Kant - Dual nature of reality
            * Physical world vs perceived world.
    * As far as this class is concerned, we’re drawing the line here:
        * **Virtual Reality** = Where everything that the user sees & hears is controlled by the created experience. 
        * **Augemented Reality** = You are adding things to the real world.
    * Difference b/w layering content on top of the world (Google Glass) and being part of the world
    * Talked about hololens as not the most ideal device in the real world but our ideal lab device
    * Two **huge** technologies that make it a killer AR headset
        * **Display** and **Sensors**
        * The Hololens is made by the same company as the Kinect
    * Even though it is not widely available, expensive, and technically only for “developers,” it is **really good at what it can do**.
    * **Creative Coding** is a type of computer programming in which the goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional.
* Fix mistake from last time

## AR/VR design principles continued
### Interaction
* Why are we jumping into code right away?
    * We need code as **Triggers** in what we make
        - Beyond what we set up
        - Lets us change (Do) stuff in the scene
* User interaction and expectations
    * What do we mean by **interaction**?
    * Show GUI vs text
* Designing for interaction
    * What (what is the actual input and output)
    * How do we cue that interaction
    * The technology enables interactions
        * Sometimes we force old interactions into new technology
    * **expectations** and **teaching**
    * skeuomorphism
        * Apple notes/audio apps
* Screens vs Space
    * All of a sudden we have to think about context for what we make
        * VR Deals with it by creating environments
            * Netflix web example, netflix VR example
            * VR "Home" interfaces - need a context for the screens we use
    * Not constrained by available resolution, but by space in the real world
    * Interesting challenge about this is that we're moving towards unknown. There are no answers.
    * Show ruler/measure ARKit App
    * Scale really matters
* Two concepts I want to focus on today:
    * **Manipulation**
        * UI Fidelity/Ease (expectation)
        * Types of manipulation
            * Trigger (1D?)
            * 2D (we take this for granted but it was not always this way)
            # 3D examples
                * Power Glove
                * Oculus/Vive handles
                * IR/Tracking examples
            * "Passive" interaction?
                * 3d spatial sensing
        * Hololens designers focused on defining a set of interactions to work with
            * gaze
            * two gestures + tracking
            * voice input
                * All the big tech companies have voice plays right now
                * Facebook lab working on brain wave reading
        * Show 3D/VR keyboard
    * **Exploration**
        * Natural, but limited in space?
        * Case study: Overheard

## Pull up HoloLens Case Studies
* Think about:
    * Manipulation
    * Exploration
    * Immersion/emotion
    * and most of all why? Why why why?


## Group assignment
* _When asked, "How could you possibly have done the first interactive graphics program, the first non-procedural programming language, the first object oriented software system, all in one year?" Ivan replied: "Well, I didn't know it was hard.”_
* Information in the real world you wish you could touch. Or you wish was available in a different way
* Change something about the real world
* No bad ideas
* It could be a tool, or a format, or anything
* Specifically think about where technology is a barrier?
* **Email** is a bad example.
    * The exercise isn't how do we make _email_ better, it's how do we _replace_ email.
* Don't underestimate the value of telling a story - even if something is useful

WHY

Making the invisible visible

* AR/VR design continued
    * Designing physicality
    * What makes something "real"
    * Virtual "weight" and realism

* Microsoft Hololens Input and Interaction


Case studies

Think about POV


What is "active" - i use the wrong shortcuts all the time

We are in the GEOCITIES phase




Stuff you don't think about: menus?
every time facebook gets redesigned?



Joseph Kosinski - "Narrating Space"
    - Architecture/Jazz/Aerospace engineering (don't worry about what you go to school for)
    - Design <--> Engineering
    - Be self critical
    - "Exploring the blurred boundaries between architecture, film, and graphics"
    - Blending the virtual and the real.
    - "Photo surrealism"

Don't underestimate the value of telling a story - even if something is useful

People are disarmed by working a new

Emotion as presence

Problems with _manipulation_ based displays
- fatigue
- minority report.

As a designer, you have to share design with your team
    - people have problem with imagination
