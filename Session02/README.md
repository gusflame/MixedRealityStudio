# Session 01 - 08/22/17

## Recap
* Miscellaneous reminders:
    * Remember that lecture slides, notes, and reading will be on [github](https://github.com/ivaylopg/Tech421Tech3706)
    * Today will mostly be spent working in Unity, building our skills
        * First session of each week will usually be talking/discussion, second sessions will be more technical.
* Topic Recap
    * We want to come up with a working definition of AR/VR
    * _Inducing targeted behavior in an organism by using artificial sensory stimulation, while the organism has little or no awareness of the interference._ - LaValle
    * Immanuel Kant - Dual nature of reality
        * Physical world vs perceived world.
    * So much out there is marketing term or people trying to be the first to coin phrases.
        * As far as this class is concerned, we’re drawing the line here:
        * **Virtual Reality** = Where everything that the user sees & hears is controlled by the created experience. 
            * It is a world built from the ground up, and you (as the creators) are responsible for creating all the rules of how this world behaves and what the expectations are.
        * **Augemented Reality** = You are adding things to the real world. 
            * The rules/expectations of the real world still apply, and you can leverage that to your advantage.
        * What about _Mixed Reality?_ 
            * You'll see this term a lot if you start looking up Hololens tutorials or example projects.
            * Mixed Reality is a *type* of augmented reality, where the physical (ie - the real world) and the virtual can interact and affect each other.  More than just an overlay onto your field of view, MR knows what you are looking at.
    * We will be working mostly in AR for the first part of this course

## Working with Hololens
* **Google Glass** - April 15, 2013 Google glass comes out. 
    * This is, for many people, the first "mainstream" or "Consumer" head-mounted display. 
    * This is **NOT AR**. Why?
        * It is just a screen that floats in your field of vision. 
        * It does not have any relationship to 3D space that you are in …. just provides some contextual information.
* Reason we bring up Google Glass is to look at the way it's display works
    * Google Glass uses a translucent mirror to reflect a projected image onto the back of your eye.
    * Projected image was about the size of the projector itself, so it was very small (floated in the corner of your vision).
        * Small image is bad for **immersion**
* **Microsoft Hololens** is a "developer" device (i.e. technically not for consumers...yet)
    * Two **huge** technologies that make it a killer AR headset
    * **Display**
        * Hololens uses a _wave-guide_ based screen. Projected image can be much bigger than the projector.
        * Still very limited in size, but (barely) able to cover your field of view instead of just a corner of your vision.
            * Much much better for feeling of immersion and presence
        * Check out the reading list below for a much more technical explanation of the screen.
    * **Sensors**
        * The Hololens is made by the same company as the Kinect
            * Uses similar technology to constantly map its surroundings and feed that data back into the experiences that it is running.
* So why use Hololens for this class?
    * Even though it is not widely available, expensive, and technically only for “developers,” it is **really good at what it can do**. Not a lot (that we can use in class) currently comes close
    * It is currently the only wearable device that comes close to “ideal” AR, so we will use it as our ideal test lab.

## Jumping into coding
* **Creative Coding** is a type of computer programming in which the goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional.
    * In this context we can use code to enable/empower/drive our creative and aesthetic projects. It is the other side of the same coin as Unity's graphical editor.
    * The emphasis on the code we write in this class is to enable prototyping quickly

## Assignments for next time
* Finish reading: [Virtual Reality - Chapter 1](http://vr.cs.uiuc.edu/)
* Make sure you've set up Unity somewhere you can work.
* Find examples of AR that interest you, or that you would possibly like to copy or borrow for a project. Try some creative coding blogs like [Creative Applications](http://www.creativeapplications.net) or [Prosthetic Knowledge](http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/)

## Coding Resources
Some of you asked for suggestions on where to turn to learn coding.
* [Hello Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bPQ9L0hvXM&list=PL64OnOdZ_3NGD4qvRucx7BpKUZ-IqGc0Q) is a great place to start that would specifically help you in _this_ class. He covers a good intro to Unity as well as coding in general.
* One of my favorite general learn-to-code resources is anything by [Daniel Shiffman](https://vimeo.com/shiffman/collections) at NYU. He has a series of videos called [Computer Programming for the Total Beginner](https://vimeo.com/channels/introcompmedia), but once you've got the very very basics down (what are variables? what are functions?) I would highly recommend his [Nature of Code](https://vimeo.com/channels/natureofcode) videos.
