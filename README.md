This class will explore various platforms for the design and creation of AR and VR applications. Emphasizing hands-on experimentation, this experiential studio is meant to be a collaboration between both programmers and designers to research and develop new paradigms for user experience and new pipelines for the creation of 3D content. Using the Unity game engine and various hardware equipment, such as the Microsoft Hololens, HTC Vive, and mobile devices, students will work individually and in teams to practically apply novel design principles, culminating in a semester project demonstrating a critical approach to designing for these emerging forms of media.


### Class Format
This class is brand new for the department. I want to create an environment where you can experiment with new techniques and practices, which are themselves in constant flux as the technology changes and finds its audience. 

The class will be structured as a hands-on lab - lectures will serve to introduce or explore concepts that are then put to the test. 

The first session each week (Tuesday) will tend to be more theoretical, while the second (Thursday) will dive deeper into execution, coding, and implementation.

We will be on our feet. We will move fast and break things so that we learn how to fix them. We will venture outside and get our hands dirty. You may be asked to split into groups - others may be relying on you to complete a portion of a larger project and it will be your responsibility to deliver.

The schedule below is tentative and will _very likely_ change over the first couple weeks. Please check the git repository each week to find the most up to date schedule and topics.


### Reading and Course Notes
This course will not have an assigned textbook. Rather, students are required to read or watch additional material as assigned each session. We will be leaning heavily on participation and discussion in this course, and these readings will help get a better intuition and deeper understanding into relevant topics.

All presentation materials, notes, and referenced texts will be made available via this git repository as soon as possible after each session.


### Requirements and Grading
Your final grade will be made up from:
* Participation, attendance, in-class projects/exercises: 60%
* Midterm project: 15%
* Final project: 25%

## Coding Resources
Some of you asked for suggestions on where to turn to learn coding.
* [Hello Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bPQ9L0hvXM&list=PL64OnOdZ_3NGD4qvRucx7BpKUZ-IqGc0Q) is a great place to start that would specifically help you in _this_ class. He covers a good intro to Unity as well as coding in general.
* One of my favorite general learn-to-code resources is anything by [Daniel Shiffman](https://vimeo.com/shiffman/collections) at NYU. He has a series of videos called [Computer Programming for the Total Beginner](https://vimeo.com/channels/introcompmedia), but once you've got the very very basics down (what are variables? what are functions?) I would highly recommend his [Nature of Code](https://vimeo.com/channels/natureofcode) videos.
