# Session 10 - 02/20/18

## Design Process
* **Double Diamond** is the name of a design process model developed by the British Design Council in 2005
    * _Different designers manage the process of design in different ways. But when we studied the design process in eleven leading companies, we found striking similarities and shared approaches among the designers we talked to._
        * Alessi, BSkyB, BT, LEGO, Microsoft, Sony, Starbucks, Virgin Atlantic Airways, Whirlpool, Xerox, Yahoo!
    * **Very useful to structure development of ideas when otherwise so open ended**
* Phases of this process are either diverging or converging. During a **diverging** phase, you try to open up as much as possible without limiting yourself, whereas a **converging** phase focuses on condensing and narrowing your findings or ideas.
* Each phase isn't necessarily equal in time, it is **equal in weight/importance**
    * **Discover** - The first quarter of the Double Diamond model covers the **start of the project**. Designers try to **look at the world in a fresh way, notice new things and gather insights**.
    * **Define** - The second quarter represents the definition stage, in which designers try to **make sense of all the possibilities** identified in the Discover phase. **Which matters most? Which should we act on first? What is feasible?** The goal here is to develop a clear creative brief that frames the fundamental design challenge.
    * **Develop** - The third quarter marks a period of development where **solutions or concepts are created, prototyped, tested and iterated**. This process of trial and error helps designers to improve and refine their ideas.
    * **Delivery** - The final quarter of the double diamond model is the delivery stage, where the **resulting project (a product, service or environment, for example) is finalized, produced and launched**.

## Minimum Viable Product
* _The Lean Startup_ - by Eric Ries
* _"Maximum amount of validated learning about customers with least effort."_
* Basically, identify the most important core of the idea and build that first before you incrementally improve and add to it.
* Also can think about it as **Riskiest Assumption Test** 
    * There is no need to build more than what’s required to test your largest unknown. 
    * No expectation of perfect code or design. No danger it will prematurely become a product.
* A way to very quickly get to something usable that gets you “from point A to point B”.

## Planning your Midterm
* Ask yourself, "What is my MVP?"
* Non-Obvious user interactions:
    * Once we have MVP, but how do we get the user there? 
    * What scaffolding do we need around it to make it a final product?
* Do you need explicit instructions?
    * Narrative vs Utilitarian
        * Option A: _“Hello Special Agent X. I see you’ve arrived at our training facility…”_
        * Option B: _“Walk to destination without touching the lasers”_
    * Neither is "correct" but one may be more appropriate for the kind of idea you are making.
* Do we have multiple levels? Do they increase in difficulty? How do we define how a level has ended?
* Does our experience have an end?
    * What is our endgame? 
        * Go until you die? Time limit? Reach specific "last" level?
* What info do we need to present to user?
     What level are we on?
        - Levels get more complicated as we move along.
        - How?
            - More obstacles
            - Moving obstacles  - What score?
    - Have you finished level?
What info do we need to keep track of?
    - States?
        - Level Finished/Building new level
        - Game over
    - Health/Lives?
* **Feature Creep** - Beware of adding too much incrementally
* **Pseudocode/FlowChart/Anything!**
    * Create an informal high-level description of your project
    * Use to plan out the logic of how to implement some of these defined components.

## Midterm Projects 
* **Due March 21**
* Projects and Documentation "Journals"
    * Three entries about project.
    * "I wanted to do X, but when my friend tried it, she did Y, so I had to go back and..."
