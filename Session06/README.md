# Session 05 - 09/05/17

## Design Principles Continued - UI and UX
* User interaction and setting up expectations
    * Example of baby trying to zoom/pinch on magazine after using iPad
* Designing for interaction
    * What? (what is the actual input and output)
    * How do we cue that interaction?
    * The technology enables interactions       
    * **Skeuomorphism** as a design approach
    * Design for **Manipulation**
    * Design for **Exploration**
        * Natural, but limited by available space.
        * Exploration can be a manipulation too: content can react to your position
* **UX (User Experience)** is the design of how the user interacts with your program and **UI (User Interface)** is the visual manifestation of the design
* **Diegetic** and **Non-Diegetic**
    * Diegetic elements are part of the fictional world ("part of the story"), as opposed to non-diegetic elements which are stylistic elements of how the narrator tells the story ("part of the storytelling”).
    * In movies, subtitles and voiceover are non diegetic. The music coming out of John Cusack’s boom box in Say Anything is diegetic…
    * …but the music playing in the scenes of Tom Hardy in Dunkirk is non-diegetic (We would not hear it if we were in the cockpit with him)…
    * …and the music playing in the scenes of Tom Hardy in Mad Max is a grey area (Some music is in the scene, some is a score in the movie).
* Examples:
    * Heads-Up-Display (Terminator)
        * **Non-Diegetic**
        * Not attached to or part of anything in the scene - serves as a “narrator” describing things in the scene.
    * Menu Attached to In-scene Objects (Tiltbrush menu and MIT AR interface prototype)
        * Diegetic
        * Menu attached to an object you can manipulate in the scene - feels like it some thing in the scene.
    * Flat Panes Floating in Space
        * Diegetic
        * A convenient bridge between screens and space
        * Still can use principles of 2D (pixel-based) design where appropriate.
        * A good argument for doing this: _The less realist the shape is, the easier the user can understand it’s a foreign element, and be enticed to start interacting with it._ (It's obviously not something in the scene just meant to be looked at)
    * Moving-Around/Exploring
        * Diegetic
        * Discover new info about scene by moving around and actually looking from different points of view.
        * Interaction can be built around this - not just passive “looking”
* Neither is "right" or "wrong" but both approaches have implications for how you lead a user through your project

## Jumping Back Into `C#`
* Why are we jumping into code in lecture about design?
    * We need code as **Triggers** in what we make
        - Beyond what we set up
        - Lets us change (Do) stuff in the scene
* I want to cover some more core concepts today so that we can have enough time on Wednesday for other stuff...
* Intro to **Object Oriented Programming**
    * What are `classes`?
    * `public`, `private`...
    * ...and `static`
    * **Instances** and *Instatiation*
        * Just a fancy word for a new copy
* OOP usually defined as having:
    * *Polymorphism*
    * *encapsulation*
    * *Inheritance*
* **Vector** overview (See slides)
* Raycasting (See slides)
* Pseudocode
    * Separating your input from your output
    * Create pseudocode for teleportation
